# Iterating through loop
# for s in Students:
#     print(s," ",end="")
# print()

# i = 0
# while len(Students)>i:
#     print(Students[i],end=" ")
#     i = i + 1
# print()

# Another way to iterate using for loop

# for j in range(len(Students)):
#     print(Students[j],end=" ")
# print()

# # Reverse iterate 
# for j in range(len(Students)-1-1,-1): 
#     print(Students[j],end=" ")
# print()
# # Starts from len-1 to 0 but here is -1 because of the ending index is exclusive in python and step by -1


# # Another simple way 
# for i in reversed(Students):
#     print(i,end=" ")
# print()

# for i in range(1,6,1):
#     print(i)


#square = []


# for i in range(1,11):
#     square.append(i*i)
# print(square)


# '''Simple Statistics'''
# print(min(square))
# print(max(square))
# print(sum(square))

# '''List Comprehension'''

# squares = [i**2 for i in range(1,11)]
# print(squares)
